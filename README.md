## Why This Exists

Building a game solo with AI is powerful — but a single chat session has no structure. No one stops you from hardcoding magic numbers, skipping design docs, or writing spaghetti code. There's no QA pass, no design review, no one asking "does this actually fit the game's vision?"

**GameStudio** solves this by giving your AI session the structure of a real studio. Instead of one general-purpose assistant, you get 55 specialized agents organized into a studio hierarchy — directors who guard the vision, department leads who own their domains, and specialists who do the hands-on work. Each agent has defined responsibilities, escalation paths, and quality gates.

The result: you still make every decision, but now you have a team that asks the right questions, catches mistakes early, and keeps your project organized from first brainstorm to launch.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`)
- **Recommended**: [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) (for hook validation) and Python 3 (for JSON validation)

All hooks fail gracefully if optional tools are missing — nothing breaks, you just lose validation.

### New project

1. **Clone the template** (or click **"Use this template"** on GitHub for a fresh repo with no history):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bullish0x/gamestudio.git my-game
   cd my-game
   ```
2. **Open Claude Code:**
   ```bash
   claude
   ```
3. **Run `/start`** — it asks where you are (no idea / vague concept / clear
   design / existing work) and routes you. No assumptions.
4. **Run `/setup-engine`** — pick your track (guided, or name it:
   `/setup-engine godot 4.6`, `/setup-engine phaser`, `/setup-engine threejs`).
   It pins the version in `CLAUDE.md` and fills version-aware reference docs.
5. Follow the pipeline (see [How to Use](#how-to-use)) — `/help` always tells
   you the next step.

> Prefer to jump straight in? `/brainstorm` explores ideas from scratch.

### Existing project

Use the **installer**. It copies only the GameStudio "studio brain" (agents,
skills, hooks, rules, studio docs, engine reference, the testing framework),
**never overwrites your `settings.json`, `CLAUDE.md`, source, or design docs**,
and records every file it writes so it can update or cleanly uninstall later.

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/bullish0x/gamestudio.git /tmp/gamestudio
bash /tmp/gamestudio/install.sh install /path/to/your/project   # omit the path to use the current dir
```

If a file already exists and differs from yours, the installer **skips it and
writes a `*.gamestudio` side-file** instead — so your `settings.json` (hooks/
permissions) and `CLAUDE.md` are preserved untouched. Diff the side-files and
merge the studio's `hooks`/`permissions` blocks in when you're ready. On Windows,
run it from **Git Bash**.

**Update / uninstall / status** — safe by design: these only ever touch files the
installer owns (tracked in `.claude/.gamestudio/manifest.tsv`). Files you've
edited are kept and the new version is offered as `*.gamestudio-new`:

```bash
bash /tmp/gamestudio/install.sh update    /path/to/your/project   # re-sync to the latest studio brain
bash /tmp/gamestudio/install.sh uninstall /path/to/your/project   # remove only the studio brain
bash /tmp/gamestudio/install.sh status    /path/to/your/project   # show what's installed
```

Then in the session:

1. **`/project-stage-detect`** — audits your repo and reports which phase you're
   in and what's missing.
2. **`/adopt`** — brownfield format audit: checks your existing GDDs/ADRs/stories
   against the template's expected structure and produces a numbered migration plan.
3. **`/setup-engine <yours>`** — pin the engine you already use so agents verify
   APIs against your version.
4. **`/reverse-document`** — generate any missing design/architecture docs from
   your existing code.

> The `cp` commands above are POSIX (macOS/Linux/Git Bash). On Windows PowerShell
> use `Copy-Item -Recurse` (and `-Force` only where you intend to overwrite).

## How to Use

GameStudio turns one Claude Code session into a directed studio: **you make the
decisions**, specialized agents do the domain work, and quality gates catch
problems before they compound. You drive it with slash commands (see
[Slash Commands](#slash-commands) for what each does).

### The mental model

- **Skills** (`/command`) are workflows you invoke. **Agents** are the specialists
  skills route work to (a director/lead/specialist hierarchy). **Rules** enforce
  standards automatically when you edit matching files. **Hooks** validate on
  commit/push/session events.
- **The files are the memory.** Decisions live in `design/` (GDDs), `docs/`
  (architecture/ADRs), and `production/` (sprints, state) — not in the chat. Any
  session can resume by reading them.
- Every agent follows a collaborative protocol: **ask → present 2–4 options →
  you decide → draft → ask before writing.** Nothing is committed without sign-off.

### 1. Pick your engine

Run `/setup-engine` (guided) or name it: `/setup-engine godot 4.6`,
`/setup-engine phaser`. Supported tracks — language pinned, version-aware:

| Track | Engine | Lead agent |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Native | Godot 4 / Unity / Unreal Engine 5 | `godot-` / `unity-` / `unreal-specialist` |
| Web 3D | Three.js / React Three Fiber | `threejs-specialist` |
| Web 2D interactive | PixiJS v8 | `pixijs-specialist` |
| Web 2D games | Phaser 4 | `phaser-specialist` |

`/setup-engine` pins the version in `CLAUDE.md` and fills version-aware reference
docs so agents verify APIs against your installed release.

### 2. Follow the pipeline

The studio works in phases; each has its commands and a gate before the next:

1. **Concept** — `/brainstorm` → `/art-bible`. *(Gate: `/gate-check`)*
2. **Systems design** — `/map-systems` → `/design-system` (per system) →
   `/review-all-gdds`.
3. **Architecture** — `/create-architecture` → `/architecture-decision` (per
   ADR) → `/create-control-manifest` → `/architecture-review`.
4. **Pre-production** — `/prototype` (validate the idea) and `/vertical-slice`
   (validate the full loop) → **PROCEED/PIVOT/KILL**.
5. **Stories** — `/create-epics` → `/create-stories` → `/story-readiness`.
6. **Implementation** — `/dev-story` (routes to the right programmer/engine
   specialist) → `/code-review` → `/story-done`.
7. **QA** — `/qa-plan` → `/smoke-check` → `/regression-suite` → `/bug-triage`.
8. **Release** — `/release-checklist` → `/launch-checklist` → `/changelog` →
   `/patch-notes`.

Not sure where you are? `/project-stage-detect` audits the repo and `/help`
surfaces the next step.

### 3. Building a web game

Pick the web track in `/setup-engine`, then the web engine agents pull from the
web skill library automatically:

- **`threejs-specialist`** (3D) — scenes, R3F, ECS, mobile, lighting/animation;
  delegates GLSL to `webgl-shader-specialist`, assets to `web3d-asset-pipeline`.
- **`pixijs-specialist`** (2D interactive) and **`phaser-specialist`** (2D games)
  — share `web2d-asset-pipeline` (atlases/Spine) and `webgl-shader-specialist`
  (2D filters). Phaser rule of thumb: keep gameplay state in systems; scenes are
  thin view adapters.

You can also invoke any reference skill directly (e.g. `/pixi-assets`,
`/phaser-tilemaps`, `/threejs-lighting`).

### 4. Control the rigor

Set review intensity with `--review` on any skill, or in `production/review-mode.txt`:

- **`full`** — all director gates (highest scrutiny).
- **`lean`** — phase gates only (default for most solo work).
- **`solo`** — no gates (fast prototyping).

### Model & context

**GameStudio works on any Claude model** — Opus, Sonnet, standard or 1M context.
The one gotcha is billing, not compatibility: the **1M-context variants (`[1m]`)
need usage credits**. Context-heavy skills like `/reverse-document`, `/adopt`,
and `/review-all-gdds` read a lot of files, so on a 1M model without credits
you'll hit a *"1M context usage credits required"* error.

Two ways through it:
- **`/model`** → pick a standard-context Opus/Sonnet (no `[1m]`) — works with no credits. Recommended default.
- **`/usage-credits`** → enable 1M and it works fine, big window and all.

A SessionStart hook flags this automatically if you start on a 1M model. For very
large existing codebases, scope heavy skills to one system/module at a time
rather than the whole repo at once.

### Resuming later

Start a new session and run `/start` or `/help`; the session-start hook previews
saved state from `production/session-state/`. The docs in `design/`, `docs/`, and
`production/` hold every decision, so nothing is lost between sessions.

## How It Works

### Agent Coordination

Agents follow a structured delegation model:

1. **Vertical delegation** — directors delegate to leads, leads delegate to specialists
2. **Horizontal consultation** — same-tier agents can consult each other but can't make binding cross-domain decisions
3. **Conflict resolution** — disagreements escalate up to the shared parent (`creative-director` for design, `technical-director` for technical)
4. **Change propagation** — cross-department changes are coordinated by `producer`
5. **Domain boundaries** — agents don't modify files outside their domain without explicit delegation

### Collaborative, Not Autonomous

This is **not** an auto-pilot system. Every agent follows a strict collaboration protocol:

1. **Ask** — agents ask questions before proposing solutions
2. **Present options** — agents show 2-4 options with pros/cons
3. **You decide** — the user always makes the call
4. **Draft** — agents show work before finalizing
5. **Approve** — nothing gets written without your sign-off

You stay in control. The agents provide structure and expertise, not autonomy.

### Automated Safety

**Hooks** run automatically on every session:

| Hook | Trigger | What It Does |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `validate-commit.sh` | PreToolUse (Bash) | Checks for hardcoded values, TODO format, JSON validity, design doc sections — exits early if the command is not `git commit` |
| `validate-push.sh` | PreToolUse (Bash) | Warns on pushes to protected branches — exits early if the command is not `git push` |
| `validate-assets.sh` | PostToolUse (Write/Edit) | Validates naming conventions and JSON structure — exits early if the file is not in `assets/` |
| `session-start.sh` | Session open | Shows current branch and recent commits for orientation |
| `detect-gaps.sh` | Session open | Detects fresh projects (suggests `/start`) and missing design docs when code or prototypes exist |
| `pre-compact.sh` | Before compaction | Preserves session progress notes |
| `post-compact.sh` | After compaction | Reminds Claude to restore session state from `active.md` |
| `notify.sh` | Notification event | Shows Windows toast notification via PowerShell |
| `session-stop.sh` | Session close | Archives `active.md` to session log and records git activity |
| `log-agent.sh` | Agent spawned | Audit trail start — logs subagent invocation |
| `log-agent-stop.sh` | Agent stops | Audit trail stop — completes subagent record |
| `validate-skill-change.sh` | PostToolUse (Write/Edit) | Advises running `/skill-test` after any `.claude/skills/` change |

> **Note**: `validate-commit.sh`, `validate-assets.sh`, and `validate-skill-change.sh` fire on every Bash/Write tool call and exit immediately (exit 0) when the command or file path is not relevant. This is normal hook behavior — not a performance concern.

**Permission rules** in `settings.json` auto-allow safe operations (git status, test runs) and block dangerous ones (force push, `rm -rf`, reading `.env` files).

### Path-Scoped Rules

Coding standards are automatically enforced based on file location:

| Path | Enforces |
|------|----------|
| `src/gameplay/**` | Data-driven values, delta time usage, no UI references |
| `src/core/**` | Zero allocations in hot paths, thread safety, API stability |
| `src/ai/**` | Performance budgets, debuggability, data-driven parameters |
| `src/networking/**` | Server-authoritative, versioned messages, security |
| `src/ui/**` | No game state ownership, localization-ready, accessibility |
| `design/gdd/**` | Required 8 sections, formula format, edge cases |
| `tests/**` | Test naming, coverage requirements, fixture patterns |
| `prototypes/**` | Relaxed standards, README required, hypothesis documented |

## Design Philosophy

This template is grounded in professional game development practices:

- **MDA Framework** — Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics analysis for game design
- **Self-Determination Theory** — Autonomy, Competence, Relatedness for player motivation
- **Flow State Design** — Challenge-skill balance for player engagement
- **Bartle Player Types** — Audience targeting and validation
- **Verification-Driven Development** — Tests first, then implementation

## Customization

This is a **template**, not a locked framework. Everything is meant to be customized:

- **Add/remove agents** — delete agent files you don't need, add new ones for your domains
- **Edit agent prompts** — tune agent behavior, add project-specific knowledge
- **Modify skills** — adjust workflows to match your team's process
- **Add rules** — create new path-scoped rules for your project's directory structure
- **Tune hooks** — adjust validation strictness, add new checks
- **Pick your engine** — use the Godot, Unity, or Unreal agent set (or none)
- **Set review intensity** — `full` (all director gates), `lean` (phase gates only), or `solo` (none). Set during `/start` or edit `production/review-mode.txt`. Override per-run with `--review solo` on any skill.

## Platform Support

Primary development and testing on **Windows 10** with Git Bash. All hooks use POSIX-compatible patterns (`grep -E`, not `grep -P`) and include fallbacks for missing tools, so they should run on macOS and Linux. The `notify.sh` hook uses PowerShell for Windows toast notifications and is a no-op elsewhere — desktop notifications on macOS/Linux are not yet wired. Cross-platform testing is ongoing; please file issues for any platform-specific breakage.
